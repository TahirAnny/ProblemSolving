## Problem

Table Activities:

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| sell_date   | date    |
| product     | varchar |

There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.
 

Write an SQL query to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activities table:

| sell_date  | product    |
|------------|------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |

Output: 

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

Explanation: 
 * For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
 * For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.
 * For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

## Solution

      /* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

      SELECT ac.sell_date, 
             COUNT(DISTINCT ac.product) AS num_sold,  
             STUFF
              (
                  (
                      SELECT DISTINCT ',' + a.product 
                      FROM Activities a 
                      WHERE a.sell_date = ac.sell_date
                      FOR XML PATH('')
                  ),
                   1, 1, ''
              ) AS products                     
      FROM Activities ac
      GROUP BY ac.sell_date 
      ORDER BY ac.sell_date
